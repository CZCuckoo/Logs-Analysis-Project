# Logs-Analysis-Project

## Description
This is a project created for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Course. The intent is to simulate a real-life scenario in which you've been asked to build an internal reporting tool that will use information from this database to discover what kinds of articles the site's readers like. It poses three questions.

* <strong>What are the most popular three articles of all time?</strong>
* <strong>Who are the most popular article authors of all time?</strong>
* <strong>On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?</strong>

Note that all requisite files were taken from the Udacity Github location found <a href="https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm">here</a>.
